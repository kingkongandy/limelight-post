# ✅ OpenAI Billing Error - FIXED!

## What Was The Problem?

You got this error:
```
"You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details."
```

This means your OpenAI account doesn't have billing set up or has run out of credits.

## ✅ Solution Implemented: MOCK MODE

I've added a **Mock Mode** toggle so you can test the entire system **without needing OpenAI credits**!

### **How It Works:**

1. **Open AI Agent Panel** (click "AI Agent" button in top-right)
2. **Look for the yellow "Mock Mode" toggle** at the top
3. **Turn it ON** to use fake stories (no OpenAI credits needed)
4. **Turn it OFF** when you've set up OpenAI billing
