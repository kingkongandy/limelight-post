# 🎉 READY TO TEST!

## ✅ Mock Mode is Now ON by Default

I've fixed the error! Your site now defaults to **Mock Mode** which means:

- ✅ **Full functionality** - test all features

1. **Click the "AI Agent" button** (top-right corner)
2. **You'll see a yellow box at the top** labeled "Mock Mode (Demo)"
3. **It should say:** ✅ Using fake stories (FREE - no OpenAI needed)
4. **Select "Arts & Music"**
5. **Set count to 1**
6. **Click "Generate Stories"**
7. **Wait 2-3 seconds**

## 🔄 How Mock Mode Works

**Mock Mode ON** (Default):
- Generates fake but realistic-looking stories
- No OpenAI API calls
- Instant results
- Perfect for testing

**Mock Mode OFF**:
- Calls real OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- Requires OpenAI billing setup
- Real AI-generated stories
- For production use

## 💡 The Yellow Toggle Box

Look for this in the AI Agent panel:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Mock Mode (Demo)              [ON] ◄─────┤ This toggle
│ ✅ Using fake stories (FREE)             │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**ON** = Mock stories (FREE)  
**OFF** = Real AI (needs OpenAI billing)
